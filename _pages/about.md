<h1>About Me </h1> 
<div style='text-align: justify;'>I am Sahar Almahfouz Nasser, a final year PhD Scholar at the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay</a>. My  PhD research is focused on introducing a range of novel deep learning based algorithms that automatically register medical images. My expertise lies in developing robust supervision, weakly-supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised techniques for medical image registration. I am associated with MeDAL (Medical Imaging, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence Lab) and am working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>. Earlier, I obtained my Master's degree from the department of biosciences and bioengineering engineering at <a href="https://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">IIT Bombay</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty/paul-d/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Debjani Paul</a>, where I developed a novel single test image-based automated machine learning system for distinguishing between trait and diseased
blood samples.</div>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>During my research, I was fortunate to work and communicate with various collaborators from the perspective of broad interdisciplinary research during my PhD. In my PhD I mainly focussed on MRI-Ultrasound fusion in prostate diagnosis and
surgery funded by <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">Qualcomm</a>.  During my PhD, I also got the opportunity to work with <a href="https://actrec.irins.org/profile/171416" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof Tabassum Wadasadawala</a>, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai where we are working on the aesthetic evaluation of breast cancer conservative treatment. I also had research assosciations with <a href="https://actrec.gov.in/disease_managment_groups/breast" style="text-decoration: none;"> Dr Purvi Haria</a> for transforming breast cancer diagnosis where I developed a method for real-time ultrasound to mamogram conversion for cost-effective diagnosis.</div>

<br>I maintain a list of my publications under the Research tab and my full Resume is attached the CV Tab.
