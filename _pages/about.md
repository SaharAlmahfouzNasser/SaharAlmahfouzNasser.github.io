<font size="5">About Me </font> 


<div style='text-align: justify;'>I am Nikhil Cherian Kurian, a senior research scholar in the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay</a>. My research focuses on introducing a range of novel algorithms that automatically analyse cancerous tissue in H&E histology images. My expertise lies in developing robust supervision techniques for large scale histopathological image analysis. I have been associated with MeDAL (Medical Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab) and working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>. I did my Masters from the department of electrical engineering at <a href="https://www.iitgn.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">IIT Gandhinagar</a>, where I developed novel information-theoretic learning algorithms for various signal processing application.</div>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>During my research, I have been fortunate to work and communicate with various collaborators from the perspective of broad interdisciplinary research. For the last couple of years, I have focussed my research on analysing and quantifying intra-tumour heterogeneity in breast cancer tissues under the mentorship of <a href="https://pathology.uic.edu/directory/peter-h-gann-mdscd/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof Peter Gann</a>, University of Illinois, Chicago.  Earlier, I have also got the opportunity to work with <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/anita-grigoriadis" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Anita Grigoriadis</a> of Kings College London, and <a href="https://actrec.irins.org/profile/171459" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof Swapnil Rane</a>, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai where we worked on solving robust pathological feature segmentation using novel deep learning pipelines to analyse breast cancer lymph nodes. I also have research assosciations with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/" style="text-decoration: none;"> Nvidia Corporation Mumbai</a> for exploratory and accelerated research in large scale histopathology problems.</div>. 

I maintain a list of my publications under the Research tab and my full Resume is attached the CV Tab.
