We investigate the impact of segmentation onmedical image registration. We propose a novel approachcalled  the  “Weakly  Supervised  Semantic  Attentive  Med-ical  Image  Registration  Network”  (WSSAMNet++),  whichemploys  segmentation  to  guide  the  registration  process.Specifically,  our  network  utilizes  the  segmentation  of  theregions of interest to direct the attention of the registrationnetwork  to  anatomically-relevant  features,  enabling  it  tofocus more effectively on the relevant parts of the images.We  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  using  segmentationand WSSAMNet++ through extensive experiments on var-ious  registration  tasks,  including  single  and  multi-modalregistration problems, on multiple datasets. Our approachdoes not require any input from the radiologist at test timeand it improves the performance of the registration networkin all the cases tested. In conclusion, our study highlightsthe  importance  of  leveraging  semantic  information  to  aidthe registration process and shows the effectiveness of theproposed method in achieving this goal.
